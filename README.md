# Global CO₂ Emissions and the shift towards Renewable Energy
### Name: Magdalena Barros 

## Description:

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global CO₂ emissions and the 
role of renewable energy in mitigating climate change, utilizing a series of 
informative visualizations to present key insights.

The bar graph of CO₂ emissions by sector for 2020 highlights the primary contributors to global emissions, with electricity and heat accounting for 60,660 million tons, followed by transportation and manufacturing & construction at 26,162 million tons and 24,964 million tons, respectively. This visualization underscores the sectors that require urgent policy interventions to reduce emissions.

The scatter plot of CO₂ emissions per capita versus GDP explores the relationship between economic development and emissions, revealing that wealthier nations like the United States exhibit higher emissions per capita, while countries such as Brazil and India show lower emissions, reflecting their different economic contexts.

A line chart depicting CO₂ emissions trends by fuel type reveals a concerning 
reliance on fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) highlighting the need for a transition to cleaner energy sources.

The map of per capita CO₂ emissions by country illustrates significant disparities in pollution levels, with Canada, the United States, and Russia showing high emissions per person, while Brazil and India rank among the lowest.

The map Share of Final Energy Consumption from Renewable Sources in 2020 highlights the progress made in renewable energy consumption, emphasizing the critical role of sustainable energy practices in reducing emissions.

In the lower section of the infographic, the trends line chart for global renewable energy generation and the stacked area chart for global renewable energy consumption depict the growth of renewable energy sources over time, emphasizing the increasing role of hydropower and wind energy.

Lastly, the bar chart of investment in renewable energy technologies showcases 
the financial commitments made towards sustainable energy solutions, with wind 
and solar energy leading the way.

Together, these visualizations not only illustrate the current state of CO₂ emissions and the progress in renewable energy adoption but also serve as a critical resource for policymakers aiming to implement effective strategies for reducing emissions and promoting sustainable energy practices globally.
