## Milestone 1: Pollution and Renewable Energy in the USA

I am interested in exploring the intersection of **pollution levels** and the use 
of **renewable energy** in the United States. This analysis will focus on visualizing:

- The amount of pollution (in terms of carbon emissions and air quality) across 
different regions (e.g., by state or county).
- The use of renewable energy.
- The investment levels allocated to renewable energy in comparison to other 
public policies.

The goal is to create **visualizations** that assist decision-makers in assessing 
the **effectiveness of renewable energy policies** and understanding the 
relationship between **carbon footprint data** and real-life pollution levels.

## Data Sources

### 1. [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
- **Description**: This resource provides global data on pollution, carbon emissions, 
and renewable energy usage. It includes visualizations and datasets offering a broader 
context for comparing pollution and energy policies in the USA to other regions.
- **Example Dataset**: CO2 emissions per capita
- **Estimated size**: Rows: 26,600 | Columns: 4

### 2. [EPA Air Quality System Data](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data)
- **Description**: Provides data on air quality and pollutant levels across various 
regions in the United States, collected by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
It includes information on common pollutants such as CO2.
- **Example Dataset**: Annual AQI by County (2024)
- **Estimated size**: Rows: 943 | Columns: 18

### 3. [US Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/)
- **Description**: The EIA provides extensive datasets on energy production and consumption in the USA, including data on renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. It also includes investment and consumption metrics.
- **Example Dataset**: Housing Data by Unit Type
- **Estimated size**: Rows: 44 | Columns: 7

### 4. [Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC)](https://afdc.energy.gov/data) (U.S. Department of Energy)
- **Description**: The AFDC provides extensive data on alternative fuels, electric 
vehicles, and infrastructure such as charging stations. This will contribute to 
understanding how renewable energy sources, especially alternative fuels and 
electric vehicles, are being adopted across the U.S.
- **Example Dataset**: Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Economic Sector
- **Estimated size**: Rows: 50 | Columns: 9

## Questions

1. Is it appropriate to mix different data sources (global and U.S.-specific) 
in this analysis, or would it be better to focus solely on U.S.-based data?
2. Given the broad scope of pollution and renewable energy, would you recommend 
narrowing down the idea further to ensure clarity and focus in the visualizations?
3. Are there additional data sources or resources that you would suggest to enhance 
the comparison between pollution levels, renewable energy use, and public investment?
