## Milestone 2: Draft

# Pollution and Renewable Energy in the World

Magdalena Barros 

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

The only change is that now is more focus on the world instead of United States, also is only focus on CO2 emissions instead of air quality. Maybe for the final I would add something about air quality.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

No. Our World in Data is a really good source. 

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.

Is on the milestone2.ipynb under each chart. I try to use for all the graphics associated with co2 colors brown and for the renewable energy ones green range. the idea is to make an infographic that also plays with these colors in the text.  


## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)

I want to create an infographic.
